Access: Since PQ doesn't need direct accessing, sequential accessing is good (have to iterating through items to check for priority level anyway)
Search: No need for direct searching, O(1)
Insertion: requires direct inserting
Deletion: only need to delete from one end, O(1) 

Reason: due to the ability to delete & insert item in O(1); prioritized speed over memory

Comparision: 
- Linked: 
	+ Access: sequential
	+ Search: sequential
	+ Insert: 0(1)
	+ Delete: 0(1)
	% Wasted: 0
	% Overhd: 4n + (pointer*3)*4 = O(n)
-----------------------------------------------
- Array-based:
	+ Access: direct
	+ Search: sequantial
	+ Insert: O(n)
	+ Delete: 0(n)
	% Wasted: O(1)
	% Overhd: pointer*4 + level-pointer*9*4 = O(1)
